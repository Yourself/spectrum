# Spectrum

Spectrum is a Windows application written in C# intended for running lighting installations.

## Installation

Note that it is currently only possible to build and run Spectrum on a 64-bit Windows computer.

1. Install [Visual Studio 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). During installation the installer will prompt you to select the components you wish to install. Make sure you select "Python development", ".NET desktop development", and "Desktop development with C++".
2. Recursively clone this repo: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/campmindshark/spectrum`
3. Open the Spectrum solution in Visual Studio and run it! Note: you will need Internet access for the first build, so if you're heading to TTITD, please compile beforehand, once for Release and once for Debug.
